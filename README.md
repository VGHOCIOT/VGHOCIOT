### Who am I? 📖

My name is Vlad, I'm a recent grad coding in a new stack, learning about the tools for success and more importantly learning how to share growth opportunities with the people around me. I love a lot of the generic things techies are really into nowadays like ultimate frisbee, bouldering and video games. I do at least pride myself in steering clear of first-person shooters and enjoying action adventure games like The Arkham Trilogy and The Last of Us as well strategy games like Civ 6.    

### What am I up to? ✏️

Currently working in my first full time role as a Jr. Full Stack Developer at [Harled Inc.](https://www.harled.ca/) and gaining all the knowledge in Ruby on Rails 💎.  As part of the team I'm improving an application we're using to provide SaaS to the RCAF, one PR at a time.

### Who do I work well with? 🤝

I work well with anyone that is approachable and values keeping open lines of communication while on the job. Pair programming is something that I've used very often and I've found that the best work gets done with workmates that keep positive attitudes on the hardest of tasks and inherently take critism just as positively! It’s important to me that my co-workers value learning as much as I do. To this point, I work well with team members that challenge me to fully understand a suggestion that is given to me on how to improve or fix an issue. The same should be true for my teammates; they should be driven by a need to improve their skills and welcome the same advice from myself, as a way to understand how to apply said fix in any context.

### What’s my prefered work environment? 🌎

An important part of my processes when getting work done is that most of my thinking is best done when I can focus on a task uninterupted for a longer period of time. It’s important that I have enough of a buffer when starting, or refocus, on a task becuase I need a period of build up to get in my “coding zone”. Because of this, I find back-to-back or closely timed meetings to be very exhaustive. The smaller the times between meetings I have during a day, the less time I have to get fully imersed in the work I have to do. Conversly, having sessions where I can improve my organizational or development knowledge with group research on different topics weekly, an exercise Harled does really well, is something that energises me to add more quality to my work. 

My approach to problem-solving is focused on getting an idea of the full spread an issue can consist of in the codebase. It’s one thing to understand what file changes will fix said issue, it’s another thing entirely to understand what other areas of the code these changes could affect. This issue could involve changes that have cleaner code that could be updated in similar files or could negatively affect the code by making sections too verbose or computationally heavy. I like to start my development processes on the outside and work my way in.
