### Who am I? 📖

My name is Vlad, I'm a recent grad coding in a new stack, learning about the tools for success and more importantly learning how to share growth opportunities with the people around me. I love a lot of the generic things techies are really into nowadays like ultimate frisbee, bouldering and video games. I do at least pride myself in steering clear of first-person shooters and enjoying action adventure games like The Arkham Trilogy and The Last of Us as well strategy games like Civ 6.    

### What am I up to? ✏️

Currently working in my first full time role as a Jr. Full Stack Developer at [Harled Inc.](https://www.harled.ca/) and gaining all the knowledge in Ruby on Rails 💎.  As part of the team I'm improving an application we're using to provide SaaS to the RCAF one PR at a time.

### Who do I work well with? 🤝

I work well with anyone that is approachable and values keeping open lines of communication while on the job. Pair programming is something that I've used very often and I've found that the best work gets done with workmates that keep positive attitudes on the hardest of tasks and are inherently take critism just as positively!
